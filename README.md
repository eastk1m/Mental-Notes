PASSWORDS!

5. Architecture
* Modular Design:
* Core Module: Basic note-taking functionality.
* Additional Modules:
* Voice-to-text conversion.
* Reminder notifications.
* Note categorization and search.
* Extensibility: Ensure the app can easily integrate new features like cloud sync or advanced search without major changes to the core.

4. Data Handling
Mock Data: Use mock data for initial development and testing.
Database Integration: If needed, integrate a lightweight database like SQLite, ensuring it doesnâ€™t complicate the core implementation.

6. Coding Practices
* Branching: Implement conditional logic to handle different user inputs and scenarios (e.g., voice vs. text input).
* Loops: Use loops for repetitive tasks like iterating over notes.
* Methods: Create reusable methods for common functionalities like saving a note, setting a reminder, etc.
* Classes: Design classes to encapsulate data and behavior, promoting code reusability and organization (e.g., Note, Reminder, Category classes).
